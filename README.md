## Rules ##
Around the World is a basketball game consisting of six shot locations (including the shot under the basket). The goal is to make it "around" the three-point line first by making baskets. If you shoot and make the shot, move to the next position and continue shooting. If you miss the shot, play continues with next person and you stay where you are,
or you can "chance" it and shoot again. If you miss your "chance" shot you start over at the first shot location.

This program simulates games of Around the World in order to determine whether a 
player should always chance it, never chance it, or only chance it for the first
half of the shots given a shot percentage.
