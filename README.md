Rules of Around the World:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variations_of_basketball#Around_the_World

## Rules in Short: ##
If you shoot and make the shot, move to the next position and continue shooting.
If you miss the shot, play continues with next person and you stay where you are,
or you can "chance" it and shoot again. If you miss your "chance" shot you 
go to the start of the game.
